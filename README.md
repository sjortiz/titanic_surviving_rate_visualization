# Titanic survivor rate

## Summary

In this visualization we can observe that the woman overall (represented by the blue bubbles) had a significant large survivor rate than the man (represented by the orange bubbles), in top of this we can see that being part of a hight class group also aumented the survival rate, therefore the first and second class had a better rate, again we can see another varibale, the age, we can observe that people in their early adulthood (21-40) had a better survival rate, when we combine all of these things we can see that the largest group of survivors correndsponds to the ones that mached all of these critereias (Young "Welthy" Womans).

## Design

I decided to go with a bubble-chart as this was one of best options to represent the 4th main variables of our fidings,
The bigger the bubble, the bigger the amount of survivors, I decided to use Pclass in the x-axis to show a clear distintion between these groups,
I choose to devide the bubbles by coloring based on the sex as I wanted to make clear the fact that the sex was a really important factor,
and I choose to change the age to a range to reduce the noise cause by the overplotting as most of the people had a different age therefore making the visualization clever.

## Feedbacks

### Misael Andre

#### What do you notice in the visualization?
	I notice the different beliefs among the classes when it comes who deserves priority

#### What relationships do you notice?
	Between the second class and the third class the amoutn of children survivors look alike

#### Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
	The graphic doesn't shows if this happens because there were more womans than mens

#### What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
	That whelty people survivor more, maybe they where closer to the lifeboats?

### James Alday

#### What do you notice in the visualization?
	Pclass is a bad label
	Age ranges are uncommon

#### What questions do you have about the data?
	total number of women/men? Hard to tell if it’s a lot of deaths in comparison to total passengers

#### What relationships do you notice?

### Maria de Jesus

#### What do you notice in the visualization?
	It's hard to tell the exact values
	Women from the first class in the range of 31-40 surviver more than the womens from other classes of the same range

#### What questions do you have about the data?
	How many survivors where there in totall?

#### What relationships do you notice?
	There is a correlation between the sex and the age, we can see in the graph that the group of women in the ages of 21-30 always survived more, across the classes.

#### What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
	Welthy womans survived more

#### Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
	Why there weren't any survivor littler girl
